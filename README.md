System Analysis and Design  

### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?  
The client for DriverPass wanted to create a system that would allow users to take practice driving tests online as well as schedule appointments for driving training with on-staff instructors. Users would be able to review tests taken, as well as feedback from the instructors. The goal was for the system to be cloud-based and accessible on both desktop and mobile browsers. The client wanted administrative rights to track user activity, generate reports, and reset passwords if required. Basic users would be able to create accounts, reset passwords, and create, edit, and view appointments for training.

### What did you do particularly well?  
Having created requirements documents before, I believe I excelled in developing the Business Requirements Document. Treating it like a project from my work experience, I was able to build a well-formatted and detailed document to outline the plan for the system.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?  
My System Design Document could have been expanded more. While it met the submission criteria, the use cases and technical requirements could have been more detailed to offer a clearer picture of the system.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?  
An initial reading of the interview transcript provided the major needs of the client: required roles, desire for cloud-based access, accessibility via the web, etc. Multiple re-readings of the transcript allowed me to dig deeper into the details. For example, a web server to host the code and logic, a database to contain system information, processes for password resets, and API connections to the DMV system were needed. As I fleshed out these requirements, they became the pieces of a puzzle that, when assembled, created the initial plan for the system design.  
Considering the user's needs is critical because they are the primary reason the system is being built. The system design fails to meet the criteria if the user's requirements are not addressed. While users may not always clearly express what they want, the designer’s responsibility is to interpret their needs and guide them in outlining their vision.

### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?  
I start with the broad strokes—what is the end goal we are trying to accomplish? From there, I move to requirements and limitations, such as whether the software needs internet access, whether accounts will need to be managed, and whether it will be on-premises or cloud-based. I continue drilling down, refining the details with the client's feedback, until we have a complete picture to outline how the system will function and the components required to make it work.  
I will likely continue using this method in the future, but I recognize that it can get bogged down in details early on, slowing progress. The key will be finding the balance between gathering enough information and maintaining forward momentum in the design process.
